# TorchShepherd

A PyTorch training harness designed to not reduce the capabilities of training procedures due to overencompassing abstractions. To accomplish this, heavy usages of lambdas allow injecting code directly into Shepherd functions, making the generalized training harness fully customizable to fit your needs.
